            <p>One of Trump&#39;s first executive actions after returning to office was to rename Denali 
                &#34;Mount McKinley,&#34; part of his idiotic culture war on &#34;woke ideology.&#34; 
                This was literally peak ignoranceâ€”denying history, native heritage, and the 
                will of Alaskans across the political spectrum<sup><a href="#reference-1">[1]</a></sup>. The mountain bore its 
                Athabaskan name meaning &#34;The Great One&#34; for millennia before an 1896 gold 
                prospector arbitrarily slapped &#34;McKinley,&#34; after a president 
                who never even set foot in Alaska. In 2015, after decades of bipartisan effort, 
                the name was rightfully restored. Trump's willful ignorance denies millenia of Alaska
                Native presence in their homeland. <strong>Let's Make Denali The Great One Again!</strong>

                During his 1896 misadventure in the Susitna basin, 
                William Dickey wrote off the Cook Inlet people's name for Denali 
                as &#34;their word for anything very large.&#34;<sup><a href="#reference-2">[2]</a></sup>
                This denial of Alaska Native people's knowledge of the land they've called home 
                for millenia was just one act of ignorance in the long history of Alaska Native erasure. 
                Restore the mountain's rightful name and Make Denali The Great One Again!

                100% of the profits from our Make Denali The Great One Again hats and stickers will be 
                donated to <a href="https://www.nativemovement.org">Native Movement</a>, a non-profit
                advocating for native rights, education, and engagement. Native Movement is not
                in any way affilated with the Make Denali The Great One campaign. Simply put, their 
                work to empower native voices is helping rectify the colonial ignorance of the past. 
                Your purchase of a hat or bumper sticker supports this vital organization and tells Trump
