            <p>One of Trump&#39;s first executive actions after returning to office was to change the name of Denali 
                to Mount McKinley, part of his culture war on &#34;woke ideology.&#34; 
                This was literally peak ignoranceâ€”denying history, Native heritage, and the 
                will of Alaskans across the political spectrum.<sup><a href="#reference-1">[1]</a></sup> 
                <br><br>
                Since time immemorial, the mountain bore its Athabaskan name, Denali, often transalted as <em>The Great One</em>. 
                The name remained until 1896 when a wealthy Seattleite arbitrarily slapped &#34;McKinley&#34; 
                on it, naming it after his preferred presidential candidate who never once set foot in Alaska. 
                In 2015, after decades of bipartisan effort, the mountain's name was rightfully restored to Denali. 
                <br><br>
                Trump's willful ignorance denies the deep history of Alaska Natives in their homeland, and he's just another 
                rich white man from the Lower 48 pushing irrelevant politics on this icon of the North.

                During his 1896 misadventure in the Susitna basin, William Dickey wrote off the Dena'ina people's 
                name for the mountain as simply &#34;their word for anything very large.&#34;<sup><a href="#reference-2">[2]</a></sup>
                We don't have to accept this denial of Alaska Natives' knowledge of the land they've always called home. 
                Restore the mountain's rightful name and Make Denali The Great One Again!
